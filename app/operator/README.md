The best case is 'migrating' all resources; prometheus, grafana, and so on; using kubenernetes operator
It means, we don't have to worry about implementation and deployment of resources.
Resources will be auto-generated by operator as you know.

By the way, it is convient to manage each configuration files.
For examlpe, when it comes to Grafana,
it is possible to make Dashboard, Datasource as a code.

But the problem is it is yet deployed well. Especially Prometheus and Grafana.
Prometheus operator   documentation sucks.
